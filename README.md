# Fuji-Llama 
This is a Llama Card game server written in GO.  
This is my first project in GO and all the server code is lifted from Eric Carr's work on 5 card stud and Fujitzee,  

so far I've just cloned his original repository 

To try and understand how the GO language works and Eric server code etc I first started with writing the Llama game as
a standalone game, you can find this in the Llama folder.  

This you can just run that and play Llama in your terminal program as 1 player against up to 5 AI bots  

The eventual goal is to make this a Fuji-net game and be hosted on a server somewhere and available in Fuji-net game lobby 
and be playable on multiply different 8 bit computers  

I'm an Atarian, so will be writing the client for the Atari 8 bit computers first and hopefully 
someone else will decide to write it for other platforms as time goes on.

Atari 8 bit version is now avalaibe as an EXE for Beta testing, in the Client folders

You can try the Web client by usign the following URL
