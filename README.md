# Fuji-Rama 
This is a Card game server written in GO.  
This is my first project in GO and all the server code is based on from Eric Carr's work on 5 card stud and Fujitzee,  


The eventual goal is to make this a Fuji-net game and be hosted on a server somewhere and available in Fuji-net game lobby 
and be playable on multiply different 8 bit computers  

I'm an Atarian, so will be writing the client for the Atari 8 bit computers first and hopefully 
someone else will decide to write it for other platforms as time goes on.

Atari 8 bit version is now avalaibe as an EXE for Beta testing, in the Client folders

I wrote a web client to try and help with debugging things and understand better what was going on with my Go server etc

It is fully  playable, but has a few UI glitches and stuff 

You can also try the Web client by usign the following URL
